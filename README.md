# MathWhiz-Builder
This project is an Android application that is intended to help students work on their math skills. The application will serve as a quiz game.  Users will answer a certain number of multiple choice questions with a set amount of time to answer each question.  These questions will range from arithmetic questions to pre-calculus type of questions. For each correctly answered question, the user will earn points.  The objective of the game is to score as many points as possible. The user will have the option to set the difficulty of the questions, ranging from easy to hard.  When the user opens the app, the home screen will include a dropdown menu to choose the difficulty of the quiz.  Two buttons will be present, one to start the quiz and one to take the user to a screen that talks about the rules of the game.  When the user clicks the start quiz button, a screen will appear with the question and possible answers.  Only one answer can be selected for each question and a countdown timer will appear on the screen, indicating how much time the user has to answer the question. Once a question is answered, the next question will appear on the screen. This process repeats until the last question is answered.  The user's final score will appear on the screen. The questions will be randomly generated from a database, where they will be stored.
